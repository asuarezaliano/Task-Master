## Technical Implementation Details

### Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) Architecture

The application implements three BFF endpoints to handle different data requirements:

1. **Tasks Endpoint (`/api/tasks`)**:

   - Manages pre-loaded tasks

2. **Labels Endpoint (`/api/labels`)**:

   - Provides access to pre-defined labels

3. **Colors Endpoint (`/api/colors`)**:
   - Manages color assignment for new labels
   - Implements a color indexing system stored in local storage to prevent color duplication
   - Ensures consistent color distribution across labels

### Performance Optimizations

- **Component Memoization**: Implemented using:
  - `React.memo` for pure components
  - `useCallback` for event handlers
  - `useMemo` for computed values
  - Prevents unnecessary re-renders in complex component trees

### Component Architecture

- Follows a modular component architecture:
  - Atomic design pattern with small, reusable components
  - Composition of larger components from smaller building blocks
  - Encapsulated functionality for better maintainability

### Styling and Theme Consistency

- Utilizes global color declarations for consistent theming
- Implements design tokens through Tailwind CSS configuration
- Ensures consistent styling across all components

### Error Handling and Loading States

Created dedicated pages for different application states:

- Custom 404 Not Found page
- Loading state components with skeleton loaders
- Error boundary implementation with error page
